## About Me

I am currently working on **Distributed Systems involving Agentic Workflows** under  
**Professor [Yogesh Simmhan](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/)** at the **Department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS), IISc Bangalore**.

I am passionate about **scalable computing**, **AI systems**, and **agentic workflows**,  
and currently exploring the orchestration of intelligent agents over **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)** backends.
